## Known Issues

### TypeScript Compilation

Some minor TypeScript issues exist in the E2E tests:

1. **Import Style Issues**
   - Using `import fs from 'fs'` instead of `import * as fs from 'fs'`
   - Can be fixed by enabling `esModuleInterop` in tsconfig.json

2. **Missing Storage Methods**
   - `saveExecution()` not found (should use `createExecution()`)
   - `updateTaskStats()` not found (needs to be added to Storage interface)

3. **Execution Update Signature**
   - `updateExecution()` expects 2 arguments, tests pass 1
   - Need to align with actual Storage interface

### Recommendations

1. **Fix Storage Interface**
   - Add missing methods to Storage interface
   - Or update tests to use existing methods

2. **Update TypeScript Config**
   - Enable `esModuleInterop` for better module compatibility
   - Or update import statements in tests

3. **Method Signatures**
   - Align test framework with actual Storage implementation
   - Update method calls to match current signatures

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Test Scenarios

   - Test ai_prompt tasks
   - Test SDK integration
   - Test tool usage tracking

2. **Advanced Triggers**
   - FileWatch trigger tests
   - Interval trigger tests
   - Smart schedule trigger tests

3. **Result Handlers**
   - Webhook notifications
   - File output handlers
   - Task chaining

4. **Analytics**
   - Tool usage analytics
   - Cost tracking
   - Performance metrics

### Performance Improvements

1. **Parallel Test Execution**
   - Enable concurrent test runs
   - Reduce overall test time

2. **Test Data Fixtures**
   - Pre-generated test data
   - Faster test setup

3. **Mock Optimization**
   - More efficient mock implementations
   - Reduce memory overhead
